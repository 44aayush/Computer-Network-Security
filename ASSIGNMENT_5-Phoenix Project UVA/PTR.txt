THREE MOST COMMAN ATTACK METHODS:
	1. Spear Phishing - * Evolved from phishing, involved millions of e-mailss asking the victims to click on a malicious link or download an infected file.
		* Attack on human vulnerability, very difficult for spam filter and automated phishing-detection system to spot spear phishing as only few selected victims in an organisation were sent this tailored e-mail messages.	

	2. Unpatched Systems - * Patches were software updates installed on computers that fixed a known system vulnerability.
		* Since UVA's ITS managed several hundreds of computers, it became very difficult to manage all the updates to the computer systems.
		* ITS had very little control over how and when these devices were updaed with the latest security patches.

	3. Zero-Day Exploits - * Not publicly known and did not have a patch or workaround available to fix the securiy hole.
		* Severe and very difficult to detect and mitigate. 24 zero-day were reported.

Most Common way to mitigate all three attacks was through "defense in depth". DID or Castle Defenses, was a layered approach originally concived as a ,ilitary tactic.
	Outer Wall - Proetct Citizens
	Castle - Important Resources
	Keep - Protect most valuable assets
	
	Layer 0 = The kernel, included servers that held the most sensitive university data.
		Hardening - Layers of technological and process defense built around Layer 0.

	Layer 1 = Servers (Used by employee and students access via log-in credential)

	Layer 2 = Included all employee and student devices and local servers that held no sensitive info.
		Segmeneted area for research computers.

	Ultimate Goal of DID := Harden the permiter of the network while maintaining a secure kernel, detect unauth access to resources,
		and react to security incidents as they occured.

In UVA's case, the cyberattack was detected by a federal government agency that promplty notified UVA's CIO -> EVANS

7 member team - OMAHA

1. Call Mandiant
2. Get a contract (REMEDIATION) signed with Mandiant, which cleared UVA's Procurement Office in record time.
	"Responding as quickly as you can is important becuase you don't know what the attackers are doing!"
3. Own proprietory license to monitor acivity on UVA's network servers and perform necessary forensic work.
4. Quickly discovered 2 unauth attackers from China, via unpatched systems.
5. UVA leveraged Microsoft services to focus on specific infrastructure components that needed monitored and remediated quickly.
6. OMAHA team - responsible for providing executive oversight for the remediation effort.
7. 62 servers compromised after 3 weeks of assessment.

Objective:
 1. Develop the extent of the intrusion
 2. Develop a remediation plan - Schedule a go-dark phase
 3. Execute the remediation plan - MOP, identify and track foreign attacker activities
 4. Harden UVA's defense
 5. Restore services

Challenges:
 1. What might happen if the security compromise becomes public
 2. Scheduling conflict with UVA program and events
 3. Potential technical or human resource issues
 4. System documentation shortcomings
